As js can run in the browser using v8 engine which is written in cpp 
but now to add more dynamicity to web we want to run this in server side also which can be done using nodejs which comprises v8 engine and much more than that.

but by this we loose access to some feature like dom model.

nodejs  -> javascript
cpp
assemnly language
machine language

role of node is simple that we want run js on server side and handle the request in server side.

install nodejs then type "node" to use.

to run some file do write "node fileName"
